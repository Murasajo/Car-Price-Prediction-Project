### Project Description

#### Car Price Prediction Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build accurate predictive models by exploring and processing the dataset, engineering relevant features, and applying ensemble methods.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes various features related to car specifications.

## Project Structure
1. **Importing Libraries**: Loading necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Loading Data**: Reading the dataset and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying missing values, data types, and extracting unique values to gain insights into the dataset.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing ones and handling missing data to improve model performance.
5. **Modeling**: Implementing different machine learning algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and using ensemble methods to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```sh
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
   ```sh
